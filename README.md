## 🧭 Who I Am

I’m a developer focused on clarity, discipline, and ethical design.  
Inspired by Islamic principles *niyyah* (intention), *ihsan* (excellence), and *adl* (justice), I build digital tools that reflect spiritual presence and creative precision.

Code can be an act of remembrance.  
Software can become a signal of integrity.

## 🕋 Principles I Follow

> “Actions are judged by intentions.” — Hadith

Coding is never just a task. It’s a reflection of who we are, what we value, and the impact we leave.

I commit to:
- Writing clear, well-commented code
- Designing for dignity and accessibility
- Building tools that serve, not exploit
- Practicing growth through discipline, humility, and purpose
