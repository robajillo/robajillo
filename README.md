# 🌿 RobaJillo: Code, Ritual, and Revival

Welcome to my digital atelier—where programming languages are reawakened through poetry, ritual, and community.

## 🔥 Who I Am

Hi, I’m **Roba Jillo**, a Moringa School graduate and creative technologist. I spent six immersive months mastering full-stack development—from HTML to PHP, Angular to Flask. Now, I’m reigniting that knowledge with a fresh approach—using **art, metaphor, and healing practices** to make technical learning unforgettable.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

- 🧰 **Code Recall & Rituals**  
  Rebuilding memory through symbolic JavaScript lessons (like variables as treasure boxes and loops as dances of return).

- 🎮 **Guessing Game Function**  
  An interactive JavaScript project blending logic with storytelling and play.

- 🌀 **Learning Garden Archive** *(in progress)*  
  A living, shareable space where code meets creativity, designed especially for children and beginners.
